# RelayBot---Discord.js
Simple Discord Relay Bot

Configure the config.json

<prefix> Needs to be the prefix you wish to use.  I normally use %%
<token> This needs to be replaced by your discord token
<RequiredRole> This is a role you give people on the server who are AUTHORIZED to use the bot. (Security Feature?)


The purpose of this bot is to take anything typed in 1 channel and repost it (From the Bot) to another channel
of your choice.

Example
\#BotChannel - \<prefix> <#generalchats ID> This is from the bot

\#GeneralChats - Bot "This if from the bot"

NOTE: There has to be a space between the <channel ID> and the <message>  The bot will yell at you if you get it wrong :P
